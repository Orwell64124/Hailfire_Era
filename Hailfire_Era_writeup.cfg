1.Why I thought I could make an era that added novel strategic options to Wesnoth multiplayer

There are seven factions in the Default era, and each of them are defined by the sum of their unit's relationship to two game mechanics:  terrain(which affects movement and defenses) and time of day(which affects chance to hit), along with other factors like movement, resistances, and range. Depending on whether most of the units in a faction are better suited to forests, rocky terrain, or neither, as well as whether the faction is mostly lawful, chaotic, or neutral, you can determine many of the options that any two of the seven factions will have available when placed in conflict. 

I wanted to create an additional factor detailing Wesnoth factions and adding new options for faction identity. My main goal in creating this era was to attempt a Wesnoth multiplayer setting that was slightly more complicated than the Default era, while having the strong balance between eleven factions that the Default era has between seven. By adding a third game mechanic also I hope to deepen the strategic significance of each individual unit by gaining a new tool to aid balance with. TL:DR, I created an alternative to competitive mainline for those who are tired with it, and I intend to maintain it for a long time.

2. Deciding that the fewer changes I made to the seven defualt factions (as of 1.15), the better.

“Keep it simple”. I wanted to make fewer changes to the first seven factions when possible. While testing out my changes, my hope was that making few changes would do more to create new strategies while limiting the amount of rebalancing after release. This makes it easier to evaluate the three new factions and see if remaining changes should be made. The WEAPON_SPECIAL_MAGICAL_ICE, WEAPON_SPECIAL_MAGICAL_FIRE, WEAPON_SPECIAL_MAGICAL_CLEAR custom weapon specials are central to Hailfire Era's design and I would strongly prefer nerfing units or adjusting factions to removing these three weapon specials should they become unbalanced.

3. Weather hexes

When I made units able to change the time area of hexes on their own, I quickly noticed that shrinking the radius to one hex was necessary. On smaller maps, even changing six hexes had a dramatic impact on the units whose effectiveness depended on them. 

Also to help balance the weather mechanic "hot weather" tiles and "cold weather" tiles CANNOT be hidden by fog-of-war. If you change the weather on turn 1 of a large map, the units will not be seen but the "hot weather" or "cold weather" overlays will be clearly visible and they will know more about the faction you are using. Similarly, using the "magical clear" ability to remove an opponent's weather will be noticable by a third party. 

4. Why I decided that Undead was a better option for being "arctic" instead of the Northerners

I decided that Undead was a better option for being "arctic" over Northerners since their units already had access to magic. Unlike the Northerners, I would not have to add extra magic units in order to introduce the Undead faction to the new style of play. The Northerners faction is intended to rely on its melee units so the Orcish Shaman will be made ever more expensive and weak so as to remove weather and not much else. 

5. Why I choose Halflings and "Blacker Tide"

I chose the Halflings faction because they were unaffiliated with any other multiplayer era and seemed to be paired with the Default Era on a regular basis. Factions like these, intended as situational improvements to the Default Era instead of a dedicated, internally consistent add-on seemed like a good opportunity to attempt a more stable expansion of the Default Era. These new factions present an option for making this new game mechanic more consistent by for individual units and easier to balance between factions. 

Pagans are loosely based on "Blacker Tide" and Rebels, created for the weather mechanic specifically. In a multiplayer era which introduces a new game mechanic, I though it best if exactly one of the introduced factions relied more on the new mechanic than the other nine. Pagans are the only faction with access to more than one weather changing ability, one of two faction with all three unit types. The units have been edited to reward players for changing the weather without detracting from balance overall. Lastly, including one and only one faction that can use both types of weather will make prediction more of a factor during matches, as well as making Pagans uniquely suited to 2vs2 matches. 

Traders are loosely based on the "Blacker Tide" and "Free Saurians" factions. I think it's important to point out that the faction is intended to have average water control despite being water themed; from the beginning my aim was for an era that included both the default factions and a few new ones without replacing the default factions or letting any one faction have above average water contol. The Naga Hunter is a versatile aquatic unit and I am determined to keep it from being overpowered.

Centaurs are loosely based on the "Beastmen" faction. The faction is intended to have poor water control, and other choices were made to balance out their extremely high mobility. The main reason for including the Centaur faction is because to have at least one faction where every single unit has neutral alignment as well as neither arctic or tropic.

6. The actual factions

The Drakes
[hide=TITLE]Aside from giving all six unit trees the "tropic" affinity and adding the weather-changing unit tree, the units play the same as before. Like in the Default Era the Drakes work best with hit-and-run tactics so they act as the most aggressive "tropic" faction. Mixed lawful/chaotic, terrain independent with the 2nd best mobility of all factions. Heavily reliant on elemental resistances and strengths. The Drakes are high attack, low defense and lawful while the Saurians have low damage with high movement and are chaotic. Drakes are now heavily weather dependent along with Undead, the strongest faction in "hot weather" hexes and weakest faction in "cold weather".

The Dunefolk
[hide=TITLE]Liminal, Hill/Mountain-based, non-magic "rustic" slightly tropic faction with mobility comparable to the Drakes. Suited to a hit-and-run style of combat utilizing dusk and dawn turns, with high attack damage and multiple offensive abilities. The Dunefolk do not have diverse resistances (like Knalgans) or mulitple ranged attacks (like Rebels) with which to easily defend territory. However, the Dunefolk faction currently has access to many abilities including poison, backstab, skirmisher, and marksman, along with cures, heals +8, regenerates +4. Together, these abilities allow Dunefolk units to retreat faster than most, recover damage faster than most and gain more from battles where both sides take heavy damage.

[img]units/nagas/dirkfang.png[/img][/hide] 

The Knalgans
[hide=TITLE] Somewhat chaotic, with units either terrain-independent or Hill/Mountain-preferring. No elemental weaponry, poison, or magic but does have "backstab" and "beserk". Knalgans are the faction best suited to counter-attacks, as their Dwarvish units have low movement and damage but some of the highest hitpoints and defense in the game. The Knalgans faction has many viable strategies, but will have more opportunities than most to destroy high-damage enemy units and prolong the battle. Composed entirely of non-magic "rustic" units, Knalgans have been changed the least from the Default Era.

The Loyalists
[hide=TITLE]Loyalists are intended to remain lawful for alignment and become "rustic"(neither arctic nor tropic) for weather like the Knalgans, Rebels, and Northerners. Like the Rebels however, the Loyalists are intended to take advantage of their magic units by returning "tropic" or "arctic" areas to normal with magic. The Knalgans are intended as a rustic faction that uses damage modifiers to damage weather-using units, while the Rebels return tiles to normal before attacking. The strongest faction at daytime and weakest at night, the classic Loyalist strategy is invading enemy territory during daytme then retreating before/during nightfall. I have decided to add Ogres to the Loyalist faction. I am confident that the Loyalists having a tropic recruit in addition to its one arctic recruit is worth adding an extra unit to what is supposed the most versatile of the main factions. Aside from Loyalists, Northerners and Knalgans, all other factions have 7 Lv.1 recruits.

The Northerners
[hide=TITLE]The northerners are intended to be mostly chaotic, mostly mountain-based and "rustic"(neither arctic nor tropic) attacking at night and not relying on either new form of weather. Of the three poison-using factions, Northerners are intended to rely on poison the most out of the three. With cheap yet tough units to overrun the enemy force with sheer numbers, most Northerner units are melee-focused. The Northerners have a time-of-day based attack-retreat cycle, but are not as heavily dependent on it as Loyalists and Undead, and can often use their large amount of units to better damage and surround enemy units.

The Rebels
[hide=TITLE]Rebels are intended to be neutral for time-of-day and "rustic"(slightly arctic) for weather like the Knalgans, Loyalists, Centaurs and Northerners. Unlike the Knalgans however the Rebels are intended to take advantage of their magic units by aggressively neutralizing tropic or arctic areas with their high number of magic-using units. Forest-based, with the vast majority of units using both ranged and melee attacks. Against weather-using factions, Rebels benefit from being the only faction with two different types of weather-removing magic units. In general, Rebels reliably pressure other factions with its peerless affinity for forest hexes and the 3rd highest mobility. Last but not least, almost every unit having access to ranged attacks make it so the Rebels faction has a lower risk than most committing units to part of the map.

The Undead
[hide=TITLE]The entirely chaotic, terrain-neutral and most aggressive of the "arctic" factions. Highly resistant to some damage types while being very weak to other forms of damage, all with low movement. Possessing a complex system of weaknesses and strengths with special abilities. All units except for the Bat and Adept have the "undead" trait which means they are "arctic" while immune to poison, "drain", and zombie-plague. The Undead are very time-of-day based like the Loyalists, strong on night turns and correspondingly weak on daylight turns. They are now heavily weather-dependent also, very useful in "cold weather" territory while extremely difficult to use in "hot weather".

The Halflings
[hide=TITLE]The only faction lawful and "arctic" at the same time. Overwhelmingly lawful, the Halflings are completely arctic and terrain-independent with limited mobility and few ranged attacks. With low damage, no fire or arcane attacks and few resistances the Halflings struggle to benefit from their cheap recruitment costs with rush tactics like Northerners. Instead Halflings are intended to benefit from their high numbers by adhering to group tactics that make their "team" abilities most useful. Even with "firstrike" and "slow" abilities helping the Halfling faction is intended to take a slow, prodding approach that punishes incursions from lone enemy units. These swarming tactics minimize the risk of any one unit engaging the enemy wihtout at least one ally on an adjacent tile. As opposed to the hit-and-run of the Drakes, Halflings are intended for a slower version of the advance-and-retreat tactics Loyalists often employ.

The Traders
[hide=TITLE]Mostly chaotic, mostly tropic and terrain-independent with limited mobility. The Raiders faction will often do best claiming territory during the night then retreating during daytime in a similar fashion to Loyalists and Undead. The Raiders units have poor resistances, low hitpoints and only one recruit with six mobility(the Saurian Rogue). Instead the Traders faction has low-cost melee units and multiple forms of status held by no other faction. Instead of poison, the Naga Hunter unit tree now has "paralysis", a non-damaging status that inflicts two turns of halved movement added to an enemy with each successful hit. The Rioter unit tree has been given "burning", a status that inflicts two turns of fire damage(4 points) with every successful hit. The Shaman Apprentice recruit has a promotion that loses weather-changing in exchange for a third and final form of status. The third status is "frostbite" which inflicts two turns of cold damage(4 points) with every successful hit. Together these abilities allow the Raiders faction to advance and retreat with less risk of counter-attack. The custom weapon specials are central to the faction's design, and I would strongly prefer them to be nerfed instead of removed should they become unbalanced.

The Pagans
[hide=TITLE]This faction is blessed with cheap, dangerous units whose only real weakness is mobility. However this faction is intended for careful players, with four basic units that lose 2 hitpoints for every battle without a kill, and 4 hitpoints of healing for every live unit felled in battle. Pagans are intended as the only faction both tropic and neutral. All units were made neutral to balance the the factions, including the Drake and Minotaur units. Like the Knalgans or Rebels, Pagans are intended to use the opposite of any weather they find. With "rustic" factions like the Loyalists or Northerners, Pagans can choose both forms of weather based on which units are wanted most. The Knalgans and Dunefolk are intended as "rustic" factions that use weapon specials to defend from weather-loving units. On the other hand, Rebels and Loyalists return weather tiles to normal while attacking.

The Centaurs
[hide=TITLE]This faction features extremely high mobility, with four basic units having 7 movement. Centaurs are intended to be neutral for alignment and arctic for weather. Centaurs rely on hit and run tactics to an even greater extent than the Drakes, since their defenses are even lower. In addition to sharing the weakness to pierce attacks most mounted units have, Centaur units have an ability that causes them damage for every turn that hot weather tiles exist anywhere on the map. In exchange for this unique difficulty, Centaurs have increased damage on open, grassy hexes. All units were made neutral to balance the the factions, including the Mermaid and Yeti units. A good player using Centaurs would usually have their two-legged units occupy villages since Centaur units have such low defense. Centaurs have access to blade, pierce, impact, and arcane damage but no fire damage and the Mermaid Initiate only provides useful cold damage in places with water. Centaurs have the unit with the highest mobility of all mages and healers, but the Centaur Mystic is fragile and must constantly remove hot weather hexes and cold weather hexes to protect its allies.
