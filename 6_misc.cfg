Instead, they lurk the mountainous areas on the edges of civilization, where hungry ogre bandits provide a constant threat to travelers and caravans. While ogres are not particularly intelligent or quick, their toughness and physical strength make them a valuable asset in the armies of other races. They are especially valued by more ruthless commanders who don’t mind the ogres’ brutality. Little is known about their biology or society, if they can truly be said to have one, but they are said to attack alongside wolves and other beasts.

Humans and the cattle they keep exist in greater supply than most other living beings, and the result of such dabbling is an intelligent creature with both dexterity and strength which rivals that of drakes. For these and other reasons, minotaurs are indifferent to other races; they resent the long-gone order of human mages who presided over their creation, but are ambivalent towards other races. Minotaurs as a group are focused on two things; mecenary work for the small number of beings who can afford it, as well as careful instruction of the magical process that results in their creation. It is a cruel irony that minotaurs are solely carnivorous, despite their origin from two seperate beings who are neither."

For centuries, centaurs were enslaved by unscrupulous humans and used as thralls of burden. This legacy has left them wary of other races; especially humans. The centaurs of Wesnoth are very fast and can easily navigate around the enemy while maintaining their high speed, so long as they avoid forested areas. The horse-like bodies of centaurs make them well suited to battle as well as suited to a nomadic lifestyle. Due to their mobililty and strength, even their forges and armories can be moved from one place to another, preserving skills gained from past human captors. While some centaurs share affinity for magic similar to elves, the magically inclined among them draw strength from tundras, plains and praries rather than forests. Centaurs believe their hearts should be 'full of neutrality', and that their best hope for survival is to intervene in situations where one race threatens to dominate another."

Once seen only during historical events of destruction, dragons can reach a large size mere weeks after hatching, upon which the Drake Tribes refer to them as "Hatched Dragons". Even Drakes, the largest, strongest, and hardiest of intelligent races, can be killed in the process of raising young dragons. However the results of this husbandry are worth it, as the few foes of Drakes are wont to learn.
